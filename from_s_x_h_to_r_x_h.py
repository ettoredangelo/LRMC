# consider case in which the game on B’s home court is an even matchup (S_x_H = 0.5)
# assume that playing at home increases a team’s expected point spread by h > 0
# In such a model, h is called the home-court advantage
# If the expected point spread on B’s home court is zero,
# then the home-court advantage h must exactly cancel A’s inherent advantage over B; the two have equal magnitude.
# we expect that the game between A and B on A’s home court would be decided by 2h
# In the case of a neutral-court game,
# a team that wins by x points at home would be expected to win by x  h at the neutral site
# S_x_h denotes the probability of winning when the ex- pected point spread is x  2h
# r_x_H = S_x+h_H
